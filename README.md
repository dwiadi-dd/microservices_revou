Mini Project Assignment:
Create Microservices Using Docker


DELIVERABLES
After this project, students will be able to understand how microservice work internally.

Description
Microservice is a modern architecture that brings huge advantages. On the other hand, it also brings some limitations if we don't handle it properly.
In this assignment, we will try to create simple microservices that can talk to each other to create end-to-end functionalities. This microservices will be about e-commerce where a user can create an order. The process will involve check authentication and authorization, inventory check whether the product is still available or not, send notification, etc.
Services to be created are not limited to:
API Gateway
Order Serviceho
Inventory / Product Service
Notification Service
The tech stack of each service can vary if you want, no limitation on that. To make it smooth, try to containerize the service. 
You can split the service into more components if needed. The communication way is up to you, you can use either sync or async or combine. Please explain the trade-off and reason for your choice during the presentation.
The database is also up to you along with the schema, please choose wisely. Remember, 1 service 1 database.
[Optional] You can provide the documentation to the client like how to interact with the system. The tools to create the documentation is up to you.
[Optional] You can deploy your service in any platform so other can access it online
